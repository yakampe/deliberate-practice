# Deliberate Practice for FizzBuzz Using Inside-Out TDD

## Problem:

The task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Deliberate Practice Approach:

### Understanding the Problem:
- Begin by fully understanding the requirements of the FizzBuzz problem. Ensure clarity on when to print numbers, "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz".

### Inside-Out TDD Steps:
1. **Start Small**: Begin with writing a test for the simplest case (e.g., returning the number itself if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5).
2. **Implementation**: Write the minimal code necessary to pass this test. Focus on simplicity and clarity.
3. **Refinement**: Refactor your code for readability and efficiency without altering its behavior. Ensure your tests still pass.
4. **Incremental Development**: Write the next test for the next simplest case, which could be printing "Fizz" for multiples of 3. Implement the minimal code changes and refactor as needed.
5. **Build Up Complexity**: Continue adding tests and code for "Buzz" (multiples of 5) and "FizzBuzz" (multiples of both 3 and 5), each time ensuring all previous tests pass.
6. **Refactor**: Look for patterns and refactorings that can make the code more elegant and simple. Remember, the tests guide your refactoring; they ensure you're not breaking the functionality.
